# Interaction-with-OS-by-Gesture-Recognition
OpenCV project that allows users to interact with computer using gestures found by value channel extraction and by tracking hand motion

The aim of the project is to devise an application that captures video from a normal web camera, tracks finger and hand motion and allows the user to interact with the computer using gestures. Thus it provides an easier way to operate a computer without any direct contact with an input device thus facilitating old people and children who find it difficult to use a mouse or a track pad. The proposed system computes the average static background and subtracts the Value Channel that is extracted from the camera feed frame by frame and performs contour and convex hull detection to determine the gesture.
